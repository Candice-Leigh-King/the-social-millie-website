          ~</strong></p><p>Millie has been our social media manager for over a
          year until now, and I can confidently say that she is extremely
          flexible, organized, and genuinely social with our followers. Since
          she took over our 5 different accounts, our sales have grown
          significantly, and I was amazed to see how the community of our
          product lovers has expanded as well. It's evident that Millie loves
          what she does, and it's a pleasure to work with her on a day-to-day
          basis.</p>

          <p class="center"><strong>~ Social Media Coaching ~</strong></p><p>I
          initially participated in a comprehensive 3-month One-on-One coaching
          program with Millie and it was an absolute pleasure! Sheâ€™s focused on
          results and together we explored so much - even within just our first
          hour consultation. As a small business owner using mainly Instagram
          and LinkedIn, social media has become crucial for me to attract new
          clients. Since beginning my work with Millie, I've seen significant
          growth in engagement and my new clients are aligned with my values!
          TheSocialMillie gets it done! Thank you.</p>

          <p>Candy and Jonty took my website to another level</p><p>I turned my
          hobby into a business which meant I needed to upgrade my website. In
          search of doing so, I found The Kings and decided to have them build
          me a custom-made website because I wanted my website to stick out from
          all the rest of the websites.</p><p>I gave them an idea of what I
          wanted and they created a website more than I could have envisioned
          (and may I add that they did so in so little time). I'm absolutely in
          love with the results.</p><p>Besides being so professional, Jonty and
          Candy are very kind, and patient, and are continuously available to
          answer any question I have even after the website handover.</p>
